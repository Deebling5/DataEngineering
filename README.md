<p>

* The commands should not be copy-pasted from any source in bulk.
* Only add those commands that you use more frequently but may be unknown to other developers.

Example: `pwd`, `ls` e.t.c., are not allowed
* Follow the structure and don't forget to embed any reference links either in heading or command description.
    * Put it inside a directory if applicable
    * Give a proper heading
    * Use markdown script for [block code or inline code]((https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet#code)) to embed commands
* If the command heading is not sufficient to explain the uses, give 1 liner explanation with an example.
* I would be happy to accept your pull request even if you add `one` good command than adding `ten` not so good commands.
